      <title>PEP 768: Safe external debugger interface for CPython</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0768/</link>
      <description>This PEP proposes adding a zero-overhead debugging interface to CPython that allows debuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes. The interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code without modifying the interpreter’s normal execution path or adding runtime overhead.</description>

      <title>PEP 766: Explicit Priority Choices Among Multiple Indexes</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0766/</link>
      <description>Package resolution is a key part of the Python user experience as the means of extending Python’s core functionality. The experience of package resolution is mostly taken for granted until someone encounters a situation where the package installer does something they don’t expect.  The installer behavior with multiple indexes has been a common source of unexpected behavior.  Through its ubiquity, pip has long defined the standard expected behavior across other tools in the ecosystem, but Python installers are diverging with respect to how they handle multiple indexes. At the core of this divergence is whether index contents are combined before resolving distributions, or each index is handled individually in order. pip merges all indexes before matching distributions, while uv matches distributions on one index before moving on to the next. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.  This PEP aims to describe each of these behaviors, which are referred to as “version priority” and “index priority” respectively, so that community discussions and troubleshooting can share a common vocabulary, and so that tools can implement predictable behavior based on these descriptions.</description>

      <title>PEP 765: Disallow return/break/continue that exit a finally block</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/</link>
      <description>This PEP proposes to withdraw support for return, break and continue statements that break out of a finally block. This was proposed in the past by PEP 601. The current PEP is based on empirical evidence regarding the cost/benefit of this change, which did not exist at the time that PEP 601 was rejected. It also proposes a slightly different solution than that which was proposed by PEP 601.</description>

      <title>PEP 763: Limiting deletions on PyPI</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0763/</link>
      <description>We propose limiting when users can delete files, releases, and projects from PyPI. A project, release, or file may only be deleted within 72 hours of when it is uploaded to the index. From this point, users may only use the “yank” mechanism specified by PEP 592.</description>

      <description>This document describes the schedule and other details of the 2024 election for the Python steering council, as specified in PEP 13. This is the steering council election for the 2025 term (i.e. Python 3.14).</description>

      <title>PEP 762: REPL-acing the default REPL</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0762/</link>
      <description>One of Python’s core strengths is its interactive mode, also known as the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), or the Python console, or the Python shell. This PEP describes the new implementation of this functionality written in Python. The new REPL released in Python 3.13 aims to provide modern features expected by today’s users, such as multi-line editing, syntax highlighting, custom commands, and an overall improved interactive experience.</description>

      <title>PEP 777: How to Re-invent the Wheel</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0777/</link>
      <description>The current wheel 1.0 specification was written over a decade ago, and has been extremely robust to changes in the Python packaging ecosystem. Previous efforts to improve the wheel specification were deferred to focus on other packaging specifications. Meanwhile, the use of wheels has changed dramatically in the last decade. There have been many requests for new wheel features over the years; however, a fundamental obstacle to evolving the wheel specification has been that there is no defined process for how to handle adding backwards-incompatible features to wheels. Therefore, to enable other PEPs to describe new enhancements to the wheel specification, this PEP prescribes compatibility requirements on future wheel revisions. This PEP does not specify a new wheel revision. The specification of a new wheel format (“Wheel 2.0”) is left to a future PEP.</description>

      <title>PEP 760: No More Bare Excepts</title>
      <link>https://peps.python.org/pep-0760/</link>
      <description>This PEP proposes disallowing bare except: clauses in Python’s exception-handling syntax. Currently, Python allows catching all exceptions with a bare except: clause, which can lead to overly broad exception handling and mask important errors. This PEP suggests requiring explicit exception types in all except clauses, promoting more precise and intentional error handling.</description>
